This is the final project for the **Deep Learning** Nanodegree program at [Udacity](https://cn.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101-cn-advanced)

The project implemented **Reinforcement Learning with Actor/Critic models** to control a Quadcopter to successfully 'take off'

Project files including:  
The jupyter notebook file  [Quadcopter_RL-zh.ipynb](Quadcopter_RL-zh.ipynb)  
 - [DDPG_agent.py](./agents/DDPG_agent.py)  - Here the Agent is implemented (i.e. the Quadcopter)
 - [DDPG_model.py](./agents/DDPG_model.py)  - Here the Actor/Critic Models are implemented
 - [helper.py](./agents/helper.py) - helper functions

Here is my review for the project [Project Review](./Project-Writeup.md) (also in notebook file)  
Here is the [Project requirements](./Project-README.md)
